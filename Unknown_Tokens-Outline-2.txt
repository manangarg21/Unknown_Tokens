Abstract

Detecting sarcasm and irony in online text is
a significant challenge for NLP, particularly
in code-mixed languages like Hinglish. This
paper introduces a dual-track framework to ad-
dress this. For English, we employ a RoBERTa
model augmented with a Recurrent Convolu-
tional Neural Network (RCNN) to capture con-
textual cues. For Hinglish, we use a multi-
lingual BERT-GRU architecture enriched with
semantic knowledge from ConceptNet to han-
dle cultural and linguistic nuances. We lever-
age Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient
fine-tuning and propose an ensemble method
to integrate both tracks. Our framework will
be evaluated on benchmark datasets using F1-
score, precision, and recall to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our context-aware, mul-
tilingual approach. To address data scarcity,
we also optionally plan to introduce a novel
data augmentation pipeline to mine sarcastic
sentences from large monolingual Hindi cor-
pora using translation and semantic similarity
search.

1 Problem Statement and Motivation

Sarcasm and irony are pervasive in online dis-
course, particularly on platforms such as Twit-
ter, Reddit, and multilingual social media in India.
These figurative forms of language often reverse
the intended sentiment, making standard sentiment
analysis models fail. For example, “Great, another
power cut in summer” appears lexically positive
but conveys frustration. Such cases are not rare -
they constitute a significant portion of online con-
versations and user-generated reviews.

The challenge is twofold:
1. Context-dependence: Non-literal meaning
depends on pragmatic and discourse-level
cues.

2. Multilingual setting:

In Hinglish (code-
mixed Hindi–English), sarcasm uses cultural
references, transliterated tokens, and informal
spellings that break standard NLP pipelines.
This project aims to build a flexible, context-
aware framework for sarcasm and irony detection
in English, Hinglish and optionally Hindi using
transformer-based methods, augmented with con-
textual, semantic, and ensemble strategies.

2 Background and Related Work

Several recent studies have explored transformer-
based approaches to sarcasm detection:

1. RCNN + RoBERTa: Combining RoBERTa
embeddings with recurrent convolutional lay-
ers captures temporal dependencies missed
by vanilla transformers. This hybrid model
achieved state-of-the-art results across multi-
ple sarcasm datasets.

2. SemIRNet (Semantic Irony Recognition
Network): Incorporates ConceptNet knowl-
edge graphs for multimodal sarcasm detection.
Semantic enrichment improves performance
beyond feature alignment, showing the role of
external commonsense.

3. BERT-GRU for Hinglish: Leveraging multi-
lingual BERT with a GRU layer, this approach
effectively captures sequential dependencies
in noisy Hinglish text, achieving strong F1
scores (>0.95).

4. Data Augmentation via Translation and
Embedding: Techniques like back-translation
are common for data augmentation. More
advanced methods leverage sentence embed-
dings (e.g., from LaBSE or Laser3) to find
paraphrases or semantically similar sentences
in large unlabeled corpora.

These findings suggest that while pretrained
transformers are strong baselines, additional con-
text modeling (RCNN/GRU) and knowledge aug-
mentation (ConceptNet) further improve robust-
ness - particularly crucial for Hinglish.

3 Proposed Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are outlined
as follows:

• Develop a dual-track system for English and

Hinglish sarcasm/irony detection.

• Investigate RCNN-RoBERTa, BERT-GRU,
and SemIRNet-style knowledge augmenta-
tion.

• Explore LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to
efficiently fine-tune large pretrained models.
• Design an ensemble framework that inte-
grates English and Hinglish outputs for mixed-
language inputs.

• (Optional) Explore a novel data augmentation
technique using translation and semantic simi-
larity search to generate a new Hindi sarcasm
dataset from large monolingual corpora.

• Evaluate models comprehensively across
benchmark datasets using F1, precision, re-
call, and AUC.

4 Dataset

We will experiment with both English and Hinglish
sarcasm/irony datasets

English:

1. Tweets with Sarcasm and Irony: Kaggle
2. Dataset from isarcasm competition: Kaggle
3. SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony detection in En-

glish tweets Dataset

Hinglish:

1. HackArena Multilingual Sarcasm Detection:

Kaggle

2. Sarcasm Detection Code Mixed Dataset:

GitHub

3. Sarcasm Detection in Hindi-English Code-

Mixed Data: GitHub

Hindi (Optional): To support our data augmen-
tation strategy, we will utilize large monolingual
Hindi corpora sourced from:

1. IndicCorpv2
2. The Hindi portion of the BPCC (English-

Hindi Parallel Text)

3. The Oscar Dataset (Hindi subset)

These will be used to mine for naturally occurring
sarcastic sentences.

5 Proposed Methodology

5.1 English Track

• Base model: RoBERTa
• Architecture: RoBERTa → RCNN (captures

contextual dependencies)

• Variants: RoBERTa + BERT, RoBERTa +
XLNet, RoBERTa + LLaMA (comparative
baselines)

5.2 Hinglish Track

• Base models: IndicBERT and multilingual

BERT

• Architecture: BERT → GRU (captures se-
quence dependencies in noisy code-mixed in-
put)

• Semantic Augmentation: SemIRNet-style
enrichment using ConceptNet concepts for
cultural markers.

• (Optional) Extension to Hindi Dataset

5.3 Hinglish-English Ensemble

• Weighted averaging of predictions from En-

glish + Hinglish systems.

• Optionally experiment with stacked ensem-

bling (meta-classifier over both tracks).

5.4 Efficient Fine-tuning

• Apply LoRA adapters on all transformer
backbones to enable faster experimentation
and resource-efficient training.

5.5

(Optional) Data Augmentation via
Semantic Search for Hindi

Recognizing the scarcity of labeled Hindi sar-
casm data, we propose a novel data augmentation
pipeline to create a new dataset. This process in-
volves the following steps (suggested by the men-
tor):

1. Translation: We will take an existing En-
glish sarcasm and irony dataset (denoted as
Sar_E) and translate it into Hindi using a
high-quality machine translation model. The
resulting dataset is Sar_H ′.

2. Monolingual Corpus Aggregation: We will
compile a large monolingual Hindi corpus
(M ono_H) by combining text from Indic-
Corpv2, BPCC and the Oscar dataset.

2

3. Semantic Similarity Search: Using a power-
ful sentence embedding model such as Laser3
or LaBSE, we will generate vector represen-
tations for all sentences in both Sar_H ′ and
M ono_H. We will then perform a similarity
search to find sentences in M ono_H that are
semantically close to the translated sarcastic
sentences in Sar_H ′.

4. Dataset Creation: The set of semantically
similar sentences retrieved from the monolin-
gual corpus will form our new, potential Hindi
sarcasm dataset, M ono_H ′. The remaining
sentences (M ono_H − M ono_H ′) can serve
as a large non-sarcastic dataset.

5. Manual Verification: A crucial final step in-
volves manually sampling and reviewing sen-
tences from M ono_H ′ to validate whether
they are genuinely sarcastic. This quality
check will determine the viability of using this
augmented dataset for training the Hinglish
track models.
